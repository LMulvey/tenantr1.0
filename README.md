# Tenantr
## Tenant and Landlord Management System

### Usage
Tenantr is currently built using npm. You can install the latest version and dependencies with `npm install tenantr`.

This is super, super, super early in development so I strongly recommend that you don't even bother.

### What is Tenantr?
Tenantr is a React application built on Node.js and Express to simplify the management of tenants *and* open lines of communication between landlord and tenant without hassle. 

#### Key Features

- **Notification System** - built with flexibility in mind, *Tenantr's* notification system can be scaled to support a multitude of notifications as required by the landlord of each property. For example, landlords can allow tenants to create **Maintenance Notifications** which would allow tenants to submit maintenance requests for issues both in their suites, or if issues are noted in the public space of the building. The system allows for comments/notes by both tenant and landlord to make it easy for the landlord to treat the system as a "to-do" list, but also allow the tenant to keep an eye on their request and see if it has been acknowledged. 

- **Alert System** - landlords can send out alerts to all tenants which they will receieve on the website and via email/text message.

- **Payment Processing** - allow landlords to handle payment and lease agreements with tenants. Issue rate changes through Tenantr.
